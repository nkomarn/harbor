# Ahoy, matey! You've arrived at the configuration file, where things get a bit scary.
# Every single thing within this plugin is customizable (at least I tried to make it that way),
# so every message and plugin module can be modified here. If you would like to report a bug
# or suggest a feature, make sure to add an issue on the GitHub page for this plugin!
